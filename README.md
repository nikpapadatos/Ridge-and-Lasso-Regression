# Ridge and Lasso Regression: Theory and Comparison

## Project Overview
This project explores the application of Ridge and Lasso regression techniques, both of which are forms of regularization that address overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. The goal is to compare how these two methods perform in shrinking coefficients and feature selection using a dataset on credit balances.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)**: Shrinks all coefficients towards zero without eliminating any of them. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)**: Shrinks some coefficients and can set some of them to exactly zero, making it useful for feature selection.
- **Comparison**: Both Ridge and Lasso are compared in terms of their impact on the coefficients, and conclusions are drawn regarding their suitability for different use cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the **Credit dataset**, which contains various credit-related variables like `Income`, `Limit`, `Rating`, and `Balance` (the target variable). The aim is to predict the `Balance` using the other features.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`
- **Steps**:
  - Load the dataset and display its summary statistics.
  - Visualize the relationships between variables using a pairplot.
  - Preprocess the dataset by one-hot encoding categorical variables and standardizing the features.

### 2. Ridge Regression
- **Theory**: Ridge Regression applies L2 regularization, adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients. This helps shrink the coefficients while retaining all variables.
- **Implementation**: Ridge regression is applied to the dataset using a range of alpha values (regularization strength). The solution path for Ridge is visualized, showing how coefficients shrink as alpha increases.

### 3. Lasso Regression
- **Theory**: Lasso Regression applies L1 regularization, which can set some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
- **Implementation**: Similar to Ridge, Lasso regression is applied with varying alpha values. The Lasso solution path is visualized, demonstrating how coefficients behave as the regularization strength increases.

### 4. Comparison of Ridge and Lasso
- A side-by-side comparison of the coefficients obtained using Ridge and Lasso at a fixed alpha value is performed. The comparison highlights:
  - Ridge shrinks coefficients uniformly, while Lasso sets some coefficients to zero.
  - Lasso performs feature selection, making it a good choice when interpretability and selecting important features are priorities.

### 5. Observations and Conclusions
- Ridge regression tends to shrink all coefficients gradually, with no coefficients being eliminated, even with high alpha values.
- Lasso regression sets some coefficients to zero, effectively removing less important features as alpha increases.
- **Key Insight**: Lasso is useful for feature selection, while Ridge is better suited when retaining all features is more important, but controlling their magnitude.
